The Employee Reimbursement System (ERS) is a full-stack web application that helps manage the process of reimbursing employees for courses, 
certifications, seminars, and other professional development events. All employees in the company can login to submit requests for reimbursement and 
view their past tickets and pending requests. Finance managers can log in to view all reimbursement requests and past history for all employees in the company.
Finance managers are authorized to approve and deny requests for expense reimbursement.
